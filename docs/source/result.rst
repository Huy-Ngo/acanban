Discussion
----------

All of these use cases have been implemented in a simplistic manner,
which satisfied our goal of accessibility from all devices.

Nonetheless, there are numerous flaws that we have found in our system:

- Important features that have not been implemented:
  - notification
  - Create, view, and complete tasks on a simple Kanban board
  - discussion
  - jury's evaluation of reports and presentation
  - statistical reports for academic assistant
- Registration currently allows anyone to have as many accounts as they want,
  which is not secure.
- There hasn't been checking for maximum grade and minimum grade fraction.
- File types for reports and slides are not ensured yet.
- The user interface is not very attractive.
