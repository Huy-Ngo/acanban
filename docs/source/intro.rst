Introduction
============

Motivation
----------

Group project and internship are annual activities for last-year students in
University of Science and Technology of Hanoi (USTH).
With the university's projected growth, managing them is becoming a complicated
yet important task.  The management is required for both students and the school staff.
From students' and supervisors' perspective, there should be a tool that helps
manage numerous tasks in their projects.  From faculties' academic assistants'
perspective, a system that helps collect projects' progress and evaluation
is of great importance, since manual input for students' grade is an exhausting task
and can lead to error.

Therefore, a collaborative platform that students and supervisors can use
in their project, which also support academic evaluation and report, is needed.
This tool should help students manage their projects seamlessly, and academic
assistants collect statistical reports quickly.

Background
----------

Project management is a common problem, which is why it is unsurprising
that there have been a variety of project management systems.
Students and supervisors have already been using some of these systems
to manage their tasks.  We studied these systems to see how projects
are commonly and effectively managed.

Trello_,a popular web service for keeping track of tasks, uses `Kanban board`_.
A Kanban board consists of several columns, each of which contains some tasks
in a certain stage, such as *to-do*, *in progress*, *in review*, and *done*.
User can move a task from a column to another.  As this workflow is easy to learn,
it is also used by other popular collaborative platforms,
such as Jira_, Asana_, GitHub_, or Tuleap_.

Some other software, such as GanttProject_, ProjectLibre_, or `Microsoft Project`_
is modeled after another tool: `Gantt chart`_.  Gantt chart is a way of using bar chart
to visualize the schedule for the project.  This method simplifies scheduling
independent tasks to be worked on at the same time to save wait time.

Although many of project management systems above
are targeting software development projects,
The application of Kanban board and Gantt chart
as project management tools can benefit any other fields.
In fact, using Kanban board in non-IT fields is also known
to improve productivity by saving time and aid internal communication. |~| [willeke]_

As effective and popular as existing project management systems are,
they do not support academic evaluation, which is one of our main motivations.
Furthermore, it is not practical extend systems that are free software
with our use cases,
because their complexity makes it hard to study within a short period.
Therefore, we started this project to create from scratch
an academic-oriented project management system.
