Introduction
============

Motivation
----------

Group project and internship are annual activities for last-year students in
University of Science and Technology of Hanoi (USTH).
With the university's projected growth, managing them is becoming a complicated
yet important task.

we need to do it because: centralized tool for students, easy academic statistics
aim of this project: lightweight and highly usable project management system and academic evaluation

Background
----------

Project management is a common problem, which is why it is unsurprising
that there have been a variety of project management systems.

(List of similar software applications: GitHub, Jira, Trello)

However, the listed systems above:

- do not support academic evaluation
- are proprietary and not extensible
- some are free software, but we decide not to extend them due to the complexity
  also: can be heavy due to extra use cases (conflict with lightweight)

Tools used in those systems: Kanban, Gantt chart
--> apply to our system.

Report Structure
----------------

The report will contain information to reproduce the result
first: introduce problem in chapter 1
next: objective - expectation for the software
requirement - the blah blah
methodology - technologies, analysis and design, implementation
result
conclusion and future work
