Database design
===============

Since each user can have zero, one, or several projects and
a group project can have several participating users, we model
the relation between them as many-to-many.
We modeled this as double links:

- Each ``User`` object of appropriate role (student or supervisor),
  there is a field ``projects``.
- Each ``Project`` has a ``supervisors`` and a ``students`` fields.
  We model both of these fields as lists, since there can be occasions
  where two or more supervisors co-supervise a project.

In each project, there could be many tasks which participants would complete
to advance the progress of the project.  There should be thus a one-to-many
relation between ``Project`` and ``Task``, and between user and task.

For each task, we designed a comment thread, in which students can discuss
their problems, or ask their supervisors for help, to resolve them faster.
Since there can be many comments in a task, the relation between ``Task``
and ``Comment`` should be one-to-many.

There can be comments replying to other comments, constructing a tree
data structure.  This structure is described by a self-referential one-to-many
relation.

Additionally, there should be a ``File`` data table
for storing reports and slides.
We allowed uploading multiple reports and slides,
considering that the group can continually
update their reports and presentations,
which can be reviewed by any participants.  All the uploaded revisions
should be kept separate for comparison or combination.

Therefore, there should be two one-to-many relations
between ``Project`` and ``File``.

However, a file in ``File`` table
does not necessarily tie to any project, since they can be referred in comments
or by academic assistants in their statistical reports.

Visually, the relations between entities described above
can be represented in :numref:`rel`.

In each entity, there are other attributes and metadata which assists
the management.  They are described in the following sections.
